# Cirkitly

We build **AI tools for hardware engineers**.

Cirkitly turns specs and ideas into **real hardware artifacts** — RTL, testbenches, optimized kernels, and layout-ready designs — without glue code or painful flows.

If you work with **Verilog, FPGAs, accelerators, or silicon**, this org is for you.

### What lives here

* Specs → RTL + tests
* Prompt-driven Verilog & FSMs
* AI-assisted placement & routing
* C / Python → CUDA / HLS
* End-to-end hardware flows

Everything is **open, modular, and composable**.

### Why we exist

Hardware tooling is slow, manual, and fragmented.
We’re fixing that with **AI-first workflows** and **software-like ergonomics**.
