# Cirkitly

> **AI-Accelerated Hardware Design Tools** â€” From spec to silicon in seconds.

Cirkitly is a modular open-source stack of intelligent agents and tools that reimagines the way digital hardware is designed. We use AI to radically simplify chip and accelerator development â€” from natural language specs to synthesizable RTL, optimized CUDA/HLS kernels, and layout-ready netlists.

Whether you're a student, FPGA developer, or silicon architect â€” **Cirkitly accelerates the hardware workflow** with clarity, automation, and AI augmentation.

## What Can Cirkitly Do?

| Tool          | Description                                                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spec2rtl`     | Convert structured specs â†’ RTL + testbench + sim script                 |
| `rtl-copilot`  | Prompt-based Verilog generator & smart FSM editor                       |
| `picoplace`    | Lightweight placer-router with AI hints and SVG layout visualizer       |
| `cuda-genie`    | AI compiler that converts C/Python â†’ optimized CUDA/HLS kernels         |
| `silicon-agent` | Integration orchestrator that runs spec â†’ RTL â†’ sim â†’ layout â†’ report   |

## Why Cirkitly?

Hardware development is traditionally:
- Slow
- Manual
- Fragmented
- Opaque

**Cirkitly fixes that** by introducing intelligent automation and an end-to-end AI-first stack, giving you:

âœ… Rapid prototyping  
âœ… Seamless integration  
âœ… Natural language interfaces  
âœ… Powerful abstractions
